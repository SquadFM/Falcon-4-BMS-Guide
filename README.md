--------------------------------------
## BEFORE ENTERING RUNWAY

0. TAXI TOWARDS RUNWAY - follow designated taxiways towards runway; stop before crossing a runway or entering the final runway ON the runway hold lines - this will trigger ATC and they will ask you to switch to tower (flight lead has to stop on runway hold line)

2. LF - GEAR: PARKING BRAKE > UP (enable)
3. LF - GEAR: LANDING LIGHTS > ON
4. LB - IFF: MASTER > NORM
5. LB - EXT LIGHTING: POSITION > FLASH
6. RF - SNSR PWR: RDR ALT > ON (up; LMB)
7. UHF 3 (Tower): "Ready for departure": press TT 1 
7.1 Tower response 1: "Hold short" (don't enter runway and wait - press TT 1 again for immediate takeoff)

8. LF - GEAR: PARKING BRAKE > OFF (ANTI-SKID TO disable)


--------------------------------------
## ON RUNWAY

0. Once "Cleared for takeoff, runway xx": depart and stay on tower frequency
1. Roll to runway start postion and stop; wait for wingman
2. STICK - press NWS button (front/right, use index finger) to turn NWS OFF (correct heading with rudder)


--------------------------------------
## TAKEOFF

1. TAKEOFF w/full afterburner (especially if CAT III heavy)
2. At speed 161 for rotate lift off
3. Lift off with 10 degrees incline
4. Retract GEAR as soon as airborne (gets damaged at 300 knots)
4. At 300 knots come out of afterburner (go to MIL power) - climb towards target altitude - cruise around 320 knots CAS (calibrated air speed) (aim for a fuel flow of 5500lb) - note: the higher you fly with the same CAS, the faster the jet's true air speed (speed above ground) - fuel flow for 320 knot CAS will be the same in 5000ft and 20,000ft though (even though the speed above ground is higher in a higher altitude due to less air resistance)
4. Turn off gear lights (taxi/landing lights)
5. UHF 4 (Departure): "Report airborne": press TT TT 1 (departure will respond "fly heading xxx and resume own navigation"
6. UHF 6 (AWACS, Tactical): Switch to this frequency after 'report airborne'; UHF 6 will enable intraflight datalink
7. Reduce throttle, aim for 300 knots
8. FL - MISC
- ROLL: STRG SEL

1. on HSD page > press OSB #20 (10 o'clock - says "8") until "120" shows to see where we're going

## FL - DED - CHECK ARRIVAL TIME
1. DOBBER left (RTN) > 5
