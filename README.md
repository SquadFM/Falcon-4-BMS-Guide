- BLD - Bleed
- Bleed Air - Bleed air is compressed air taken from the compressor stage of a gas turbine upstream of its fuel-burning sections. Bleed air can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, pneumatic actuators, air-driven motors, and pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir. Bleed air is valuable in an aircraft for two properties: high temperature and high pressure.

This computerized system is called the Flight Control System (FCS). The FCS also moves surfaces as a function of the angle of attack to provide the best control. 
- FCC - Flight Control Computers (FCC) - Two flight control computers (FCC A and FCC B) provide the computations which determine the flight characteristics. Electrical signals generated by movement of the stick grip and rudder pedals are transmitted (each signal on four different channels) to both FCC. The computers use the pilot inputs and inputs from various aircraft and internal sensors to determine proper outputs to the control actuators for desired aircraft response. The multiple channel inputs and outputs are continuously monitored by the FCC for agreement. When there is disagreement, the erroneous signal is discarded or, if this cannot be determined, the control system is automatically switched to a degraded mode which does not use that signal. For survivability, one channel from each computer is routed through the upper part of the aircraft and the other channel is routed through the lower part. The stabilator and trailing edge flap servos receive four channel signals from the FCC. The aileron, rudder, and leading edge flap servos receive two channel signals.
